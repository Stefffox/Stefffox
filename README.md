## Hi there 👋

My name is **Nathanaël**, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at **Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse)**.  
I am passionate about technology and always curious about new developments happening every day.  
I hope to continue learning and one day contribute to the evolution of software through development.
